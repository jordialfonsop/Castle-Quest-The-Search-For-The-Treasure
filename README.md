# Inspiration
We drew inspiration from the thrilling experience of escape rooms and puzzle games, as well as the charm of old-timey games with simple yet well-executed concepts. The idea of creating short games that are fun, refreshing, and capable of building small micro universes with great storytelling possibilities fascinated us.

# What it does
Castle Quest is an immersive virtual reality escape room game built using Unity and Oculus Quest. Players are transported into a virtual reality environment where they must solve puzzles, interact with objects, and uncover the treasure hidden within the castle. The game mechanics allow players to pick up, throw, break, and interact with various objects, while the evolving music enhances the realism and engagement of the experience.

# How we built it
To bring our vision to life, we utilized the Unity engine as our primary development platform, taking advantage of its extensive tools and resources. One crucial component we incorporated into our development process was the XR Interaction Toolkit, which provided us with the necessary framework for implementing VR interactions seamlessly. This toolkit allowed us to create immersive and realistic interactions between players and the virtual environment.

In addition to Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit, we leveraged other essential tools to enhance our development workflow. GitHub served as our version control system, facilitating collaboration and ensuring the integrity of our codebase throughout the project. By utilizing GitHub, we were able to streamline teamwork, manage changes efficiently, and maintain a consistent development process.

To ensure the highest level of immersion and playability, we crafted the game using two sets of Oculus Quest VR glasses for playtesting purposes. This approach allowed us to iterate and refine the experience based on real user feedback, ensuring a seamless and captivating gameplay experience.

Underlying our development efforts was our expertise in C#, the programming language used to implement the game mechanics and interactivity. Through our proficiency in C#, we were able to code a wide range of functionalities, including object manipulation, puzzle-solving mechanics, and immersive interactions, elevating the overall gameplay experience.

# Our team
We took a semi-professional approach to game development, with each member specializing in a particular aspect of the game. We had experts in level design, storytelling, audio and sound design, and coding, allowing us to tap into our individual strengths while collaborating closely to overcome obstacles and combine our abilities. This collaborative synergy within our team fostered the creation of a highly engaging and polished game. That also extended to us deciding to keep things simple and reduce the level of content for the sake of a better overall delivered experience.

# Challenges we ran into
Our journey was not without its fair share of challenges. We encountered technical hurdles and faced quirky bugs that resulted in unexpected and comical situations. From coins falling off the map to inadvertently creating a magical flying broom due to colliding hitboxes, we navigated through these obstacles with a lighthearted spirit.

However, our team's perseverance and problem-solving skills allowed us to overcome these challenges, enhancing our overall game development expertise. By maintaining a positive attitude and utilizing our collective knowledge, we transformed hurdles into opportunities for growth and improvement.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a captivating virtual reality escape room game that brings joy, excitement, and storytelling possibilities to players. Our game successfully immerses players in a rich and detailed environment, allowing them to engage with objects and solve puzzles in a realistic and interactive manner. The collaborative effort of our specialized team resulted in a highly polished and engaging game that we take great pride in.

# What we learned
Throughout the development of Castle Quest, we embarked on a journey of learning and growth. Leveraging Unity's VR capabilities, we built our application, immersing players in a virtual reality environment. Using C#, we coded the game mechanics, allowing players to interact with objects by picking them up, throwing them, breaking them, and performing various interactions.

We delved into the realm of VR game development, acquiring knowledge on implementing basic concepts specific to virtual reality. Techniques such as level design and storytelling were put into practice within the constraints of our development timeline. This learning experience enabled us to broaden our skill set and gain a deeper understanding of creating immersive gaming experiences.

# What's next for Castle Quest
Looking ahead, we have exciting plans for Castle Quest. We aim to expand the game by adding more levels, puzzles, and interactive elements, providing players with a longer and more challenging experience. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of integrating multiplayer features, allowing players to embark on the quest together, collaborating to solve puzzles and uncover the treasure. We are committed to refining and enhancing Castle Quest based on user feedback and continuously pushing the boundaries of immersive VR gaming experiences.

# Controls
- Use the left and right grab on the controllers to grab and drop objects
- Use the left joystick to move around
- Use the right joystick to teleport using an arch
